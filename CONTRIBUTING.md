    As doing such i will follow up with yourself whenvere possible to ensure that you can be trustworthy for this repository :)

# Why do i have to be whitelisted for this project? id thought this was an open source project?
This **is** an open source project but this is also **how** im putting myself out there on the internet for people to look at this and see "oh this is CalebOWolf's page" instead of using a lintree or a website or something other than those methods. i'm wanting to be more unique about myself and what i like the most which for me is GitHub and coding. thus i made this repository for just that
  as for the open source and whitelist its due to the fact that i need to be able to not have someone ultimatley destroy this project and have to start over from scratch. **I** am open to suggesstions as to how to prevent this so cotact myself above and this can be talked about such.
